# Yr9-T3-Computing
This is my computing project for year 9, term 3. It is a landing page to promote two scratch games, Hacksafe and Virus Defender. The website includes a homepage with (mock) statistics, features, (mock) testimonials, an about section, and a feedback section. There are seperate webpages for each game, which will provide a brief overview as well as the game's features, and a gallery. Documentation is included in the docs section of our website, with a website structure, a detailed directory, and our official documentation. 

Not all data is real or useable, and there is no real corporations involved. This is a school project and has no relations to any other companies whatsoever.
